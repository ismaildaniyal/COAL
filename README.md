# Snake Game in Assembly (x86)

This project is an implementation of the classic **Snake Game** using **x86 Assembly language**. It showcases low-level programming concepts to create a simple yet efficient gaming experience. The x86 Assembly code is designed to run on compatible platforms.

## üöÄ Features

- **Classic Snake Game Mechanics**: Relive the nostalgia of the traditional Snake Game with smooth controls and engaging gameplay.
- **Low-Level Programming**: Efficiently coded using x86 Assembly, demonstrating the power and complexity of low-level programming.
- **Console-Based Interface**: A simple and lightweight interface that runs directly in the console.


## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Snake-Game-x86.git
   cd Snake-Game-x86
   ```

2. **Assemble the Code**:
   Use an x86 assembler like **NASM** to compile the assembly source code:
   ```bash
   nasm -f bin snake_game.asm -o snake_game.com
   ```

3. **Run the Executable**:
   Use a DOS emulator like **DOSBox** or a compatible environment to run the executable:
   ```bash
   dosbox snake_game.com
   ```

## üí° Use Cases

- **Learning Tool**: Ideal for understanding low-level programming and x86 Assembly language.
- **Game Development**: Explore how classic games can be built using minimal resources.

## üñ•Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language**: x86 Assembly
- **Tools**: NASM (Netwide Assembler), DOSBox (for execution)
